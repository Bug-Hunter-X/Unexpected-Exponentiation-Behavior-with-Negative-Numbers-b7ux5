# Julia Exponentiation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to exponentiation (`^`) in Julia when dealing with negative numbers and integer exponents. The `^` operator, when used with negative numbers and non-integer exponents, can result in complex numbers which might not be what the programmer intends. The solution provides ways to handle this depending on the desired behaviour.
